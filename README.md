# 🖱️ Gesture and Voice Controlled Virtual Mouse

This project is a **contactless virtual mouse** that allows users to control their computer using **hand gestures** and **voice commands**, enhancing human-computer interaction (HCI) through real-time computer vision and speech recognition.

---

## 📌 Abstract

The Virtual Mouse system uses a webcam and microphone to detect **hand gestures** and recognize **voice commands** for controlling mouse functions. It’s particularly useful for:

- **Hands-free control** in AR/VR, robotics, classrooms.
- **Assisting specially abled** users.
- **Touchless computing** during health-sensitive situations (like COVID-19).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track hand movement using a webcam to simulate mouse movement and clicks.
- Implement fingertip and knuckle tracking using MediaPipe for gesture control.
- Develop a voice assistant (`Jerry`) using `SpeechRecognition` to:
  - Open folders/files
  - Control mouse actions
  - Perform basic navigation
- Integrate gesture and voice modules into a unified system.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### ✅ Gesture Module
- Uses **OpenCV** for video capture and **MediaPipe** for hand tracking.
- Gesture interpretation based on **21 hand landmarks**.
- Clicks and actions triggered by calculating angles and distances between fingertips.

### ✅ Voice Module
- Voice assistant **"Jerry"** built using `SpeechRecognition`.
- Listens to and interprets user commands in real-time.
